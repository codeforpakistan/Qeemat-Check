# Qeemat-Check
An app to help concerned authorities maintain a check and balance on the prices of food items

This app provides a portal where the consumer can see the prices of the items generated by the DCO office and can complain about the vendor that is over charging. The user can also compare the prices of the products offered by different vendors and can chose a vendor accordingly and can give a review about the vendor.

We have built it on android using Android Studio but we would also be making a web portal for it. We have tried to make the process as simple as possible, the user can easily access the rates from the categories and can even search a specific item. The user can also see the shops in his neighborhood and their reviews.

Fork it to get the Android Studio Project.
There is an .apk file in the bin folder so that you can install it in your mobiles.
